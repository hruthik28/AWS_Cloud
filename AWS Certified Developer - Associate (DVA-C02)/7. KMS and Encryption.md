# Exploring Envelope Encryption
1. **Envelope Encryption Process:**
    - A Customer Master Key (CMK) is used in AWS KMS to initiate the process.
    - The Generate Data Key API is utilized to create a data key (also known as an envelope key), which is used to encrypt the actual data.
    - The CMK encrypts the data key, and this encrypted data key is then used to encrypt the data itself.
    - The encrypted data key is stored alongside the encrypted data for future decryption purposes.
    - It's crucial to note that KMS does not store the data keys; only the encrypted copy is stored with your data.
2. **Decryption Process:**
    - When decrypting data, the encrypted data key is first decrypted using KMS and the CMK.
    - The plaintext data key obtained is then used to decrypt the data.
    - After decryption, the plaintext data key is deleted from memory.
3. **Benefits of Envelope Encryption:**
    - Envelope encryption minimizes network performance issues by only sending the data key (not the entire data) over the network for encryption/decryption operations.
    - This approach is more efficient, especially for large amounts of data (gigabytes or terabytes), as it reduces the data transfer overhead.
4. **Exam Tips for Envelope Encryption:**
    - Envelope encryption involves encrypting the data key (envelope key) with the CMK, which is then used to encrypt the data.
    - It's used for encrypting data larger than four kilobytes.
    - Remember the Generate Data Key API call in KMS, which creates an encrypted data key for use in envelope encryption scenarios.

Understanding envelope encryption is crucial for handling large-scale encryption needs efficiently and securely without overburdening network resources.

    - Create a new CMK by accepting the default settings.
    - Specify a name for your CMK and set key administrators and users.
    - Finish creating the key.
2. **Enabling Automatic Key Rotation:**
    - After the CMK is created, select it using the alias or identifier.
    - Go to the Key rotation tab.
    - Choose the option to enable automatic key rotation, typically set to rotate the key every year.
    - Save the changes.
3. **Disabling Automatic Key Rotation:**
    - If you need to disable key rotation, simply deselect the option in the Key rotation tab.
    - Save the changes.
4. **Exam Tips for Automatic Key Rotation:**
    - Automatic key rotation in KMS allows for the cryptographic material of CMKs to be rotated annually.
    - KMS retains the previous version of the cryptographic material, ensuring that files encrypted using the old material can still be decrypted.

Enabling automatic key rotation is a security best practice to regularly update cryptographic keys, enhancing data security without disrupting decryption processes for previously encrypted data.
