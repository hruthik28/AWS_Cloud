# Additional Resources and Summary
Thank you for sharing these valuable additional resources and tips for preparing for the exam! I'll make sure to focus on the AWS FAQs related to Serverless, developer tools, security, automation, monitoring, containers, and messaging/streaming. Additionally, I'll delve into the recommended Whitepapers such as the Well-Architected Framework, Serverless Applications Lens, Practicing Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery on AWS, Implementing Microservices on AWS, and others.

Your advice on getting the most out of Whitepapers by focusing on diagrams, key sections, and taking visual notes like mind maps is very helpful.
