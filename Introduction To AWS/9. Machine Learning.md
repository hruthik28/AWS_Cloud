# Machine Learning

- Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence where programs
learn from data and improve their accuracy over time without explicit
programming.
- An example of machine learning is a program learning to play a
computer game by trying different actions and learning from the
results.
- Machine learning is used in various industries for applications like
self-driving cars, health monitoring, credit determination, social media
rankings, agriculture, targeted email, and fashion trends.
- AWS offers several machine learning products and services:
    - AI Services: Amazon Kendra for intelligent search, Amazon
    Personalize for personalized recommendations.
    - Business Metrics Analysis: Amazon Lookout for Metrics to detect
    unexpected changes, Amazon Forecast for accurate forecasting, Amazon
    Fraud Detector for fraud detection.
    - Vision Services: Amazon Rekognition for analyzing images and
    videos.
    - Language Services: Amazon Polly for text-to-speech, Amazon
    Transcribe for speech-to-text, Amazon Lex for building chatbots.
- These AWS machine learning services provide intelligence, analytics,
vision analysis, and language processing capabilities for various
applications and industries.

# Rekognition

- Amazon Rekognition is a service that uses machine learning to
analyze images and videos.
- It can detect various objects, scenes, and activities in images with
a confidence percentage.
- Rekognition has features for image moderation, facial analysis,
celebrity recognition, face comparison, text extraction, and detecting
personal protective equipment (PPE).
- Image moderation can automatically detect adult or violent content
in images.
- Facial analysis can determine attributes like gender, age range,
emotions, and whether the person is wearing glasses.
- Celebrity recognition accurately identifies known celebrities.
- Face comparison allows comparing faces to see if they match.
- Text extraction helps extract text from images.
- PPE detection is useful for industries like construction or
healthcare.
- Rekognition has numerous applications, such as security monitoring,
content moderation, facial recognition, and more.

# DeepRacer

- AWS DeepRacer is a self-driving car created by AWS to teach
reinforcement learning, an advanced machine learning technique.
- It’s a 1/18 scale car equipped with a camera, small Intel computer,
and sensors to navigate a racetrack using vision and computing
power.
- Training the DeepRacer involves creating a model or “brain” using a
reward function algorithm.
- The reward function takes input data from the car, such as track
coordinates, distance from the center, crash status, etc., and produces
a single output based on mathematical calculations.
- The goal of the reward function is to reward the car for driving
correctly, not to explicitly program it to drive.
- DeepRacer’s machine learning service iteratively runs the reward
function to optimize the car’s performance on the track.
- DeepRacer has championships where participants can race their models
against others globally.
- A Cloud Guru offers a series covering everything about DeepRacer for
those interested in learning more.

# CodeGuru

- Amazon CodeGuru is a service by AWS that uses machine learning to
assist in code review and application performance optimization.
- It helps detect critical issues, security vulnerabilities, and
hard-to-find bugs in code, lightening the load of manual code
reviews.
- CodeGuru has two main features: CodeGuru Profiler and CodeGuru
Reviewer.
- CodeGuru Profiler analyzes code to identify expensive lines in terms
of CPU usage and provides visualizations and recommendations to optimize
performance.
- CodeGuru Reviewer uses machine learning to detect critical issues,
common bugs, and deviations from best practices in code repositories,
improving overall code quality.
- It automates code quality checks in categories like AWS and Java
best practices, concurrency, deadlocks, resource leaks, code cloning,
and input validation.
- CodeGuru Reviewer integrates with code repositories to show exact
lines of code with issues and suggestions for improvement.
- With machine learning, CodeGuru’s suggestions for code improvement
and issue detection are expected to improve over time.

# Completing Case
Studies & AWS Architecture

- The simplest website can be hosted on Amazon S3 without the need for
an EC2 instance or a web server.
- A basic blog website can use an EC2 instance connected to an Amazon
RDS database to host content.
- A load balanced blog setup involves an elastic load balancer
directing traffic to multiple EC2 instances accessing the same Amazon
RDS database.
- Adding elastic cache in front of the database improves performance
by providing fast, in-memory data to the EC2 instances.
- Incorporating CloudFront as a CDN in front of the load balancer
ensures fast content delivery to users globally.
- Highly available architectures involve multiple availability zones,
CloudFront for global content delivery, load balancing across zones, and
database replication for failover.
- AWS offers a range of services like S3, EC2, RDS, Elastic Cache,
CloudFront, and more to build complex and highly available web
architectures.
- The AWS Architecture blog is a valuable resource for learning about
architecting solutions with AWS services.
