# Management and Governance

- AWS management and governance services help organizations balance
innovation with control over costs, security, and compliance in their
cloud infrastructure.
- AWS Control Tower simplifies setting up and governing a secure
multi-account AWS environment.
- AWS Organizations centralizes governance and management across
multiple AWS accounts.
- AWS Budgets assists in planning and cost control.
- AWS CloudFormation enables modeling and provisioning of resources
using code.
- AWS Service Catalog organizes and governs a curated catalog of AWS
products.
- AWS OpsWorks automates operations with Chef and Puppet.
- AWS Marketplace offers software for deployment on AWS.
- Amazon CloudWatch monitors services via metrics and logging.
- AWS Config records and evaluates configurations of AWS
resources.
- AWS CloudTrial tracks user activity for security
investigations.
- AWS Systems Manager optimizes performance and security for managing
systems.
- Amazon X-ray analyzes and debugs production applications.
- These services make managing and governing cloud environments easier
and more efficient for AWS users.

# CloudFormation

- AWS CloudFormation allows creating infrastructure using text files
called templates, supporting both JSON and YAML syntax.
- Templates specify the infrastructure components like EC2 instances,
VPCs, or CloudFront CDNs.
- CloudFormation automates infrastructure creation based on the
template, creating a stack of resources.
- The ability to define infrastructure with code facilitates version
control, collaboration, and automation.
- Version control systems like Git help track changes and manage
collaboration on CloudFormation templates.
- CloudFormation supports nested templates, allowing modular and
team-specific template development.
- Automation benefits from CloudFormation by automating infrastructure
creation and testing processes.
- CloudFormation templates enable quick deployment and removal of
infrastructure for testing and development purposes.
- CloudFormation simplifies scaling by allowing infrastructure
replication across multiple AWS accounts and regions using the same
template.
- Multi-region functionality can be built into CloudFormation
templates for seamless deployment across regions.
- CloudFormation templates provide a structured and reusable way to
define AWS infrastructure, enhancing efficiency and scalability.

# CloudWatch

- Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service for AWS,
allowing users to collect metrics and data from various AWS
services.
- CloudWatch integrates with approximately 70 AWS services, providing
a comprehensive monitoring solution for AWS accounts.
- It automatically collects predefined metrics from services and
displays data in graphs, offering a unified view of AWS resources.
- Users can set alarms based on metric data, triggering actions based
on alarm conditions to respond to issues proactively.
- CloudWatch also supports log management by allowing users to send
log files to CloudWatch Logs, providing a centralized log store.
- Users can interactively search and analyze log data in CloudWatch
Logs, facilitating quick response to problems and issues.
- CloudWatch enables users to monitor custom metrics as well, allowing
them to graph and set alarms on any metric they choose.
- Users can create alarms for various purposes, such as monitoring
billing projections to stay within budget or detecting unauthorized
access attempts like failed SSH logins.
- Overall, CloudWatch provides actionable insights and monitoring
capabilities to ensure the availability and performance of AWS
applications and resources.

# Auto Scaling

- AWS Auto Scaling automatically adjusts the capacity of EC2 servers
based on defined conditions, allowing for automatic scaling up or
down.
- Users create an auto scaling group and specify parameters such as
minimum size (always running instances), desired capacity (usually
running instances), and maximum size (maximum instances allowed).
- CloudWatch alarms can be used to modify the desired capacity based
on metrics like CPU or RAM usage.
- Auto Scaling helps with high availability by automatically scaling
servers to meet demand spikes, ensuring applications remain available to
customers.
- It improves fault tolerance by spreading the application across
multiple servers instead of relying on a single point of failure.
- Auto Scaling also offers better cost management as resources are
only used when needed, reducing unnecessary costs.
- Auto Scaling is not limited to EC2 instances; it can also be applied
to other AWS services like DynamoDB tables and indexes, Amazon Aurora
replicas, and even custom metrics monitored by CloudWatch.
- Overall, AWS Auto Scaling is a powerful tool for optimizing resource
usage, ensuring availability, and managing costs effectively in AWS
environments.
