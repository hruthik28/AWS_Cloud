    data.
    - Industry-leading durability with 11 9s of data durability
    (99.999999999%).
    - Copies of files are stored across multiple systems in multiple data
    centers for protection against failures.
    - Offers different storage classes:
        - S3 Standard for frequently accessed data.
        - S3 Standard-Infrequent and S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access for less
        frequently accessed data.
        - Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering for automatic cost optimization by
        moving objects between tiers based on usage patterns.
2. **S3 Glacier and S3 Glacier Deep Archive:**
    - Designed for data archival and long-term backup at extremely low
    costs.
    - S3 Glacier allows query-in-place functionality for analytics on
    archive data.
    - Offers three data retrieval options:
        - Standard retrieval for low-cost retrieval within a few hours.
        - Bulk retrieval for cost-effective retrieval of large data
        amounts.
        - Expedited retrieval for quick data access.
3. **Customization and Options:**
    - AWS provides various options and storage classes to suit different
    organizational needs.
    - Users can choose storage classes based on data access frequency,
    cost considerations, and performance requirements.

Overall, Amazon S3 and S3 Glacier offer a simple yet versatile
storage solution with options for customization, cost optimization, and
reliable data durability across multiple data centers.

# EFS

Amazon EFS is a fully managed NFS shared file system for Linux EC2
servers, allowing multiple servers to access the same volume
simultaneously. It is highly scalable and durable, with automatic
storage across multiple availability zones. EFS offers standard and
infrequent access storage classes, with a lifecycle management feature
for cost-saving. It automatically scales and encrypts files, ensuring
security and eliminating manual disk management.

1. **Managed NFS Shared File System:**
    - Fully managed service for Linux virtual machines in Amazon EC2.
    - Provides NFS (Network File System) shared file system storage.
    - Allows accessing files and directories over the network that are not
    on the local system but connected to the network.
2. **Scalability and Accessibility:**
    - Multiple servers can access the EFS file system simultaneously.
    - Thousands of machines can connect to the same volume, making it
    highly scalable.
    - Highly available and durable, with files automatically stored across
    multiple availability zones in a region to prevent data loss.
3. **Storage Classes and Lifecycle Management:**
    - Offers standard and infrequent access storage classes.
    - EFS Lifecycle Management feature allows automatic moving of files to
    infrequent access storage based on aging off policy, saving costs for
    less frequently accessed data.
4. **Automatic Scaling and Encryption:**
    - Automatically grows and shrinks as files are added or removed,
    eliminating the need for manual disk management.
    - Encryption is enabled by default, ensuring that files stored in EFS
    volumes are secure and protected from unauthorized access.

Overall, Amazon EFS is a simple yet powerful service that provides
scalable, accessible, and secure file storage for Linux EC2 servers,
with features like storage classes, lifecycle management, automatic

# Storage Gateway

Amazon’s Storage Gateway offers three types of gateways: File
Gateway, Tape Gateway, and Volume Gateway. File Gateway provides SMB and
NFS interfaces to S3, enabling local applications to store and access
data in the cloud. Tape Gateway presents a virtual tape library for
backup purposes, storing contents in S3. Volume Gateway presents an
iSCSI block storage volume to on-premises applications, operating in
either stored or cached mode. All gateways offer seamless AWS
integration, efficient data transfer, bandwidth management, and network
resilience.

1. **File Gateway:**
    - Provides SMB and NFS interfaces to Amazon S3.
    - Enables local applications to store data in the cloud
    transparently.
    - Useful for storing files in S3 and accessing them with various AWS
    services.
2. **Tape Gateway:**
    - Presents a virtual tape library on the local network for backup
    purposes.
    - Compatible with major backup software, simplifying the transition to
    cloud backups.
    - Stores tape contents in Amazon S3, supporting S3 Glacier or S3 Deep
    Archive for long-term archival.
3. **Volume Gateway:**
    - Presents an iSCSI block storage volume to on-premises
    applications.
    - Operates in stored mode (local data backed up to S3 asynchronously)
    or cached mode (frequently accessed data stored locally for low-latency
    access).
    - Assists in transitioning to AWS by managing on-premises data in S3,
    providing hybrid cloud storage capabilities.

All three types of gateways offer seamless integration with AWS
services, efficient data transfer mechanisms, bandwidth management, and
automatic network resilience, making them valuable tools for
organizations transitioning to the cloud.
