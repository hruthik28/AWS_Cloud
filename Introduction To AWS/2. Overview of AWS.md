# History

AWS originated from the idea of separating applications from
infrastructure, leading to the concept of Infrastructure as a Service
(IaaS). The first AWS services, launched in 2006, were Amazon S3 and
SQS, followed by EC2. AWS has since continued to release new services
and updates, such as RDS, Route 53, and DynamoDB, with the pace of
launches accelerating over time. AWS remains highly active in
innovation, as seen in the recent announcement of DevOps Guru at AWS
re:Invent 2020. The future of AWS is expected to continue this trend of
regular service launches and updates.

1. **Origins of AWS**:
    - AWS was not created due to excess computing capacity from Amazon’s
    retail operations, contrary to popular belief.
    - Benjamin Black and Chris Pinkham explored ways to efficiently scale
    up infrastructure to handle peak traffic for websites or
    applications.
2. **Inception of AWS**:
    - They conceived the idea of separating applications from
    infrastructure, leading to the concept of selling infrastructure as a
    service (IaaS).
    - The proposal for AWS made its way to Jeff Bezos, who approved it,
    leading to the development of AWS services.
3. **Early AWS Services**:
    - Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) was the first AWS service
    launched in March 2006, followed by Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) in
    July.
    - AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), a virtual machine service, was
    released in August 2006, marking a significant milestone for AWS.
4. **Subsequent Milestones**:
    - AWS continued to launch new services, such as Amazon RDS (Relational
    Database Service) in October 2009, Route 53 (DNS service) in December
    2010, and DynamoDB (NoSQL database) in January 2012.
    - The pace of service launches accelerated over time, with updates and
    new services announced regularly.
5. **Current State of AWS**:
    - AWS remains highly active in releasing new services and updates,
    with a continuous stream of product launches and improvements.
    - The text mentions AWS re:Invent 2020, where a new service called
    DevOps Guru was announced, highlighting AWS’s ongoing innovation.
6. **Future Outlook**:
    - The text anticipates that AWS will continue to release new services
    and updates, reflecting the dynamic and evolving nature of the
    platform.
7. **Course Coverage**:
    - The course will delve into more detail about important AWS services,
    providing further understanding for learners.

Overall, the history of AWS showcases its evolution from a concept of
separating applications and infrastructure to becoming a leading
provider of cloud services with a wide range of offerings and continuous
innovation.

# Regions and Availability
Zones

AWS has physical locations called regions globally, with multiple
isolated and physically separate availability zones within each region.
Each availability zone has independent power, cooling, and security
measures, and they are connected via redundant, high-speed networks.
This structure allows AWS customers to deploy their infrastructure in a
distributed and resilient manner, ensuring high availability and fault
tolerance.

1. **Regions**:
    - AWS has physical locations called regions around the world where
    they place their data centers.
    - Regions are located in North America, South America, Europe, the
    Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific.
    - Example regions include Ohio, Oregon, North California, North
    Virginia, GovCloud West, GovCloud East, Canada Central, Sau Paulo,
    Frankfurt, London, Paris, Bahrain, Ireland, Milan, Stockholm, Cape Town,
    Singapore, Beijing, Sydney, Tokyo, Seoul, Ningxia, Osaka, Mumbai, Hong
    Kong, and Melbourne (recently announced).

2. **Availability Zones (AZs)**:
    - Within each region, there are multiple isolated and physically
    separate availability zones.
    - Availability zones have independent power, cooling, and security
    measures.
    - They are connected to each other via redundant, high-speed,
    low-latency networks.
    - AWS groups data centers into availability zones, each with a unique
    name not shared between users or accounts.
    - The purpose of availability zones is to provide redundancy and
    protect AWS workloads from issues in a single data center.
    - Redundancy across availability zones helps in mitigating risks such
    as power outages or infrastructure issues.

The combination of regions and availability zones allows AWS
customers to deploy their infrastructure in a distributed and resilient
manner, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.
